Group,"Represents a defined collection of entities that may be discussed or acted upon collectively but which are not typically expected to act collectively.  These collections are also not typically formally or legally recognized.

NOTE: Group may be used to define families or households, which in some circumstances may act collectively or have a degree of legal or formal recognition.  This should be considered an exception.  When Group is used for types of entities other than Patient or RelatedPerson, the expectation remains that the Group will not act collectively or have formal recognition - use Organization if these behaviors are needed.

For example, it is possible for a 'family' Group to be a performer of an Observation or owner of a Task.  However, this is not permitted for a Group made up of Practitioners, PractitionerRoles or Organizations.  Organization or CareTeam would need to be used instead.

Provenance,"Provenance of a resource is a record that describes entities and processes involved in producing and delivering or otherwise influencing that resource. Provenance provides a critical foundation for assessing authenticity, enabling trust, and allowing reproducibility. Provenance assertions are a form of contextual metadata and can themselves become important records with their own provenance. Provenance statement indicates clinical significance in terms of confidence in authenticity, reliability, and trustworthiness, integrity, and stage in lifecycle (e.g. Document Completion - has the artifact been legally authenticated), all of which may impact security, privacy, and trust
